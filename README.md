# textToVisual

Please find enclosed herewith my project entitled 'Text To Visual' which is required to complete my internship with Microsoft. 
    
This project converts text to visuals which help user to actually know how things apear in real world. 

For this project I have written the code in python. The project deployement is done with the Azure app service using flask framework.


problem statment:

Nowadays, from a little baby to an adult, everyone is busy with mobiles, computers, laptops , tablets & other smart devices for day to day activities. One can easily observe children listening to songs, nursery rhymes etc. on these devices. Earlier, in this age, children used to keenly observe their surroundings, color bundles of drawing books, recite the rhymes, identify and pronounce names of different objects around them which helped them to grow and nurture their brains in a better way . But all these activities seem to have vanished from the present day brought up systems. In order to continue the same nurturing pattern and avoid rot learning and that too with modern and child friendly methods, we propose a novel approach which converts text to visual and help kids not only to cram words but also help them to visualise how actually the things appear in real world.
